The project was created in the context of the course "Computational Quantum Physics" of the postgraduate program "Computational Physics" of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
### It consists of 2 files:
<ol>
<li>HOnumeric.py</li>
  The program HOnumeric.py numerically solves the Schrödinger wave equation for the 1D harmonic oscillator using the 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithm and arbitrary initial conditions.
<li>SqBilliardQM.py</li>
  The program SqBilliardQM.py solves Schrodinger's time-dependent equation for wave packet motion on a mathematical square billiard table.¶
